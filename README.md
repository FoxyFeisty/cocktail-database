# cocktail-project

Fictional cocktail webpage as practise project using Javascript, PHP and SQL. Focus on developing a relational database as well as an user back-end.

## How it works

- Webpage with overview and detail pages.
- User back-end after login with list of all entries, a form to edit entries and create new ones.

### What's still missing (because creator preferred to drink cocktails instead)

- Creating SESSION for Login
- Server-side security (so far only javascript validation of user data)
- Further restricting of image files (so far only JS checking data type)
